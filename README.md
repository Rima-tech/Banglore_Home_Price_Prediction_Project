This is a real estate price prediction website project. It predicts property prices based on area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. The project comprises three major components - A ML model, a server, and a website. I built the  ML model using sklearn and linear regression with the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle. The 2nd component is a Python Flask server that utilizes the saved model to serve HTTP requests. Finally, the third component was the website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input home square foot, bedrooms, etc., and calls the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
